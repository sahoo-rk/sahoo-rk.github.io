Glad to see you here. I am a researcher in the school of evolutionary thinking. My research interest lies at the 'population' level of the biological organisation. I employ laboratory experiments and high-throughput genomic information to gain insights into the way populations respond to their environment and how distinct ecological events such as bottleneck, migration and drift influence population resilience. 

Currently, I work as a Faculty Fellow at [CSIR-CCMB](https://ccmb.res.in), where I lead a [DST-INSPIRE](https://www.online-inspire.gov.in/) funded project to unravel the effect of historical bottleneck on contemporary population structure in a biocontrol agent with an aim to decipher potential strategies to improve the ecological resilence of the biocontrol species.

Previously, during my PhD dissertation period, I have been trained to use the
