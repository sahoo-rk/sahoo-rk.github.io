------
Glad to see you here. I am a researcher in the school of evolutionary thinking. My research interest lies at the 'population' level of the biological organisation. I employ laboratory experiments and high-throughput genomic information to gain insights into the ways populations respond to their environment, and how distinct ecological events such as bottleneck, migration and drift influence population resilience. 

Currently, I work as a Faculty Fellow at [CSIR-CCMB](https://ccmb.res.in), where I lead a [DST-INSPIRE](https://www.online-inspire.gov.in/) funded project to unravel the effect of historical bottleneck on contemporary population structure in the biocontrol species *Zygogramma bicolorata*. The project is relevant to decipher potential strategies to improve the ecological resilence of the biocontrol agent, and of bottlenecked population in general.

Previously, I have spent a year and half at [IISERBPR](https://iiserbpr.ac.in) in exploring different research questions in the same biocontrol species, for instance, its reproductive biology, chemical ecology and community-level interaction. Besides, during my PhD dissertation period at [IISERTVM](https://iisertvm.ac.in), I worked with different lepidopteran taxa to understand their evolutionary histories in relation to past ecological events under the frameworks of molecular phylogenetics and phylogeography.
