Glad to see you here. I am a researcher in the school of evolutionary thinking. My research interest spans molecular evolution, population genomics, and host-*Wolbachia* interaction. I employ laboratory experiments and high-throughput genomic information to gain insights into trait evolution in insect taxa and decipher the intriguing ecology of *Wolbachia*-mediated reproductive parasitism in insect hosts. Using comparative genomics, I investigate the ways populations respond to their environment, and how distinct ecological events such as bottleneck, migration, and drift influence population resilience.

Currently, I work as a Faculty Fellow at [CSIR-CCMB](https://ccmb.res.in), where I lead a [DST-INSPIRE](https://www.online-inspire.gov.in/) funded project to unravel the effect of historical bottleneck on contemporary population structure in the biocontrol species *Zygogramma bicolorata*. The project is relevant to decipher potential strategies to improve the ecological resilience of bottleneck population in general and that of the biocontrol agent, in particular.

Previously, I have spent a year and half at [IISER-BPR](https://iiserbpr.ac.in) exploring different research questions in the same biocontrol species; for instance, its reproductive biology, chemical ecology, and community-level interaction. Prior to this, during my PhD dissertation at [IISER-TVM](https://iisertvm.ac.in), I worked with different lepidopteran taxa to understand their evolutionary histories in relation to past ecological events under the frameworks of molecular phylogenetics and phylogeography.
