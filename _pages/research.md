Comparative genomics & trait evolution
------

Genome charactrization and comparative genomics provide insights not only to the genetic makeup of organismal traits, but also decipher the patterns of trait evolution across studied taxa. With the help of high-throughput genome sequencing data, I, currently, characterize the genome of a beetle species, both its structure and function. The project aims to delineate the genomic regions relevant for the species' evolutionary history and its ecological interactions in diverse climatic conditions.

A small founding population is observed when a handful of interbreeding individuals gets dispersed/transported from the parent population and becomes the founding members in establishing a new isolated population.


Evolution in bottleneck population
------

The fate of bottleneck population is a paradox. On one hand, bottleneck turns the resulting population vulnerable to extinction, while on the other hand, such vulnerability appears context dependent. A small founding population is observed when a handful of interbreeding individuals gets dispersed/transported from the parent population and becomes the founding members in establishing a new isolated population.
Small founding population is characterized by reduced standing genetic variation, and is prone to inbreeding, demographic stochasticity and genetic drift.
I am starting with the genomic scan of the beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata) population in India to understand the role of habitat heterogeneity and local environmental stressors in improving the population-level genomic variability.
