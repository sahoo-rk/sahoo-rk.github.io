Evolution in bottleneck population
------

A small founding population is observed when a handful of interbreeding individuals gets dispersed/transported from the parent population and becomes the founding members in establishing a new isolated population.
Small founding population is characterized by reduced standing genetic variation, and is prone to inbreeding, demographic stochasticity and genetic drift.
I am starting with the genomic scan of the beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata) population in India to understand the role of habitat heterogeneity and local environmental stressors in improving the population-level genomic variability.


Comparative genomics & trait evolution

Genome charactrization and comparative genomics provide insights not only to the genetic makeup of organismal traits, but also decipher the patterns of trait evolution across studied taxa. With the help of high-throughput genome sequencing data, I, currently, characterize the genome of a beetle species, both its structure and function. I aim to delineate the genomic regions relevant for the organism with respect to its evolutionary history and ecological interactions in diverse climatic conditions.
