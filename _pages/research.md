Evolution of small founding population
------
![Lacones image](/images/lacones.jpg){: .align-right width="3000px"}
A small founding population is observed when a handful of interbreeding individuals gets dispersed/transported from the parent population and becomes the founding members in establishing a new isolated population.
Small founding population is characterized by reduced standing genetic variation, and is prone to inbreeding, demographic stochasticity and genetic drift.
I am starting with the genomic scan of the beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata) population in India to understand the role of habitat heterogeneity and local environmental stressors in improving the population-level genomic variability.
